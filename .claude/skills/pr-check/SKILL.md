# PR Standards Check

Pre-flight validation against `.claude/pr-standards.md`.

## Context

```
!git branch --show-current
```

```
!gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,additions,deletions,changedFiles,commits,baseRefName,number 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PR_FOUND"
```

```
!git log --oneline main..HEAD
```

## Instructions

Validate the current PR against each standard below. If no PR number was provided and `NO_PR_FOUND` appears above, check only what can be validated locally (branch name, commits, diff size) and note that no PR exists yet.

For each check, output one of:
- **PASS** — Meets the standard
- **WARN** — Minor deviation, note what's off
- **FAIL** — Does not meet the standard, explain what needs to change

### Checks

**1. Branch Naming**
Branch must match `<type>/<short-description>` where type is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `style`, `docs`, `chore`. Must be lowercase, hyphen-separated. No issue numbers in the branch name.

**2. PR Title**
Must match `<type>: <imperative summary>`. Type prefix should match branch type. Under 72 characters. No period at the end. Imperative mood ("Add", "Fix"), not past tense ("Added", "Fixed").

**3. PR Description — Summary**
Must include 1-3 sentences explaining what the change does and why.

**4. PR Description — Test Evidence**
Must include how the change was verified: visual check of both variants, responsive rendering confirmed, form submission tested (if API touched), or `npm run dev` verification.

**5. PR Sizing**
Check additions + deletions (excluding generated code, test fixtures, lock files if identifiable):
- Under 400 lines → PASS
- 400-600 lines → WARN ("consider splitting")
- Over 600 lines → FAIL ("should be split")

**6. Commit Messages**
Each commit message should follow `<type>: <summary>` format. No "WIP", "fixup", or "wip" commits.

**7. References**
If the change relates to a GitHub issue, it should reference it with `Closes #N` or `Relates to #N`. WARN if no references found (not all PRs need them, but flag for awareness).

### Output Format

```
## PR Standards Check

| # | Check | Result | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Branch naming | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... |
| 2 | PR title | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... |
| 3 | Summary | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... |
| 4 | Test evidence | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... |
| 5 | Sizing | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... |
| 6 | Commit messages | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... |
| 7 | References | PASS/WARN/FAIL | ... |

**Result: X/7 passing, Y warnings, Z failures**
```

If there are failures, add a brief "Suggested Fixes" section listing what to change.
